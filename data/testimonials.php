They only have 6 rooms to rent in the main building, and yet the public areas are spacious and airy. The grounds are beautiful too, with much thought put into the landscaping. It is a family-run business and we were greeted mostly by the son. You can tell they are proud of the business and really want to ensure you have a great stay. Everything is as pictured. The free bicycles they provide for you to ride around the rice paddies is a major plus. Oh, and the rooftop lounge area is amazing too! Would definitely come back!',
